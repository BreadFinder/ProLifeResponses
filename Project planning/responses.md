## Arguments / Responses list

For arguments that aren't in the list, either add them with a PR or email me the content.

For each of the following arguments, 3 things can be done
- Write out the argument if it can be written better. (I may be just listing these quickly and not taking the time to write them out well)
- Write out a rebuttal to the argument.
- Add resources related to the argument. e.g. videos that respond to the argument

**You don't have to do all three for any of the arguments. In fact, you can just work on one if you wish.**

Each of the following arguments can have multiple responses and multiple resources.

## **Important disclaimer**
If an argument doesn't have responses or resources written out yet, it does not mean there are no responses or resources out there for it. We just haven't got to it yet for this project.

#### Collaborators currently working on this:
---

pro-choice argument:
```
Only women get an opinion on abortion.
```

You don't have to be affected by something to know it's wrong.

Example: We know that slavery is wrong even if we aren't slaves ourselves.
```

pro-choice argument:
```
We shouldn't legislate morality.
```

pro-life responses:

```
If laws aren't based on morality, what are they based on?

Murder is illegal. Why? You can say that it's to preserve life, but then your just asserting that preserving life is a good thing. If a majority of people start thinking that murdering people is ok, should we make it legal? Careful, wouldn't want to legislate your morality ;)

If laws aren't based on morality, then they are based on the hedenistic motivations of those in power.

### Argument #3
#### Collaborators currently working on this:
---

pro-choice argument:
```
It's just a clump of cells.
```

pro-life responses:

```
We are all technically clumps of cells.

The keyword is "just". This is making the argument behind the scenes that something is lacking in one clump of cells (the baby) and another clump of cells (an adult let's say). The thing that's assumed to be lacking is personhood. So now the argument becomes "It's not a person". See argument #5.
