## Arguments / Responses list

For arguments that aren't in the list, either add them with a PR or email me the content.

For each of the following arguments, 3 things can be done
- Write out the argument if it can be written better. (I may be just listing these quickly and not taking the time to write them out well)
- Write out a rebuttal to the argument.
- Add resources related to the argument. e.g. videos that respond to the argument

**You don't have to do all three for any of the arguments. In fact, you can just work on one if you wish.**

Each of the following arguments can have multiple responses and multiple resources.

## **Important disclaimer**
If an argument doesn't have responses or resources written out yet, it does not mean there are no responses or resources out there for it. We just haven't got to it yet on this project.
